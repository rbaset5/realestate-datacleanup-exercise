Finally, you already have all the necessary knowledge to prepare a real dataset to later train a machine learning model, which you will learn throughout the bootcamp.

It is intended that you apply all the knowledge learned with the other Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib notebooks, and even openCV that we will delve into later.

Feel free to add any additional analysis that you consider necessary and that is not raised in the questions.
